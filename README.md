# ComplexNumberPackage
A simple complex number implementation.
## How it works
The simple complex number package is split into two parts,
- CNumPol
CNumPol is the polar representation of the complex number. It has all base operations (+, -, *, /), and can even add with the rectangular form. However this is with the seperate method, addRect, divideRect and so forth.   
- CNumRect
CNumRect is the rectangular representation of the complex number. It has all base operations (+, -, *, /), and can even add with the polar form. However this is with the seperate method, addPolar, dividePolar and so forth.
